This file sets for the coding standards for mod_janus and janus, as 
with any other aspect of programming there are times when exceptions
to the rules make sense. 

[1] All whitespace should be spaces not tabs.

[2] Bracing and indenting should be k&r style with four spaces per tab, 
    it should conform roughly to indent -kr -ts 4.  Use extra braces to
    prevent inadvertent bugs from changing block scoping.

[3] All return values that could indicate a potential error must be
    checked.

[4] strncpy and strncat are banned!, strlcat and strlcpy are
    provided in bsdstring.
