Some notes on using and understand mod_janus
---------------------------------------------

mod_janus (formerly fcap) is a kernel module that 
janus uses for process confinement. It 
supports interposing on system calls, suspending processes,
reading call arguments in an efficient
race free fashion, querying the kernel about process metadata, 
etc. 

mod_janus the device
--------------------

mod_janus is implimented as a standard linux charecter
device. You will note that is has not been assigned a 
permanent major number and as such it requests one
dynamically everytime it is installed, hence the 
need to create a new mod_janus device entry with
install_mod each time you use the device (e.g., each
time you reboot).

Since talking to a charecter device directly is pretty icky
there is a user library the provides a nice abstraction 
for interaction with mod_janus (called fcap for historical
reasons). The interface for this library is given by
fcap.h, the library itself is typically build as libfcap.a.


mod_janus and ptrace
--------------------

You may not use mod_janus in combination with ptrace.
For security reasons, if a process is being 
ptraced mod_janus will not let you trace it; also if you
are tracing a process using mod_janus ptrace will not be
allowed to trace it.

Using libfcap
-------------

The libfcap interface is documented in fcap.h. Examples of
its use are found in trace.c in the janus code. Most of
the interesting bits of what it does can be found in
main.c and ent.S.


Apologies
----------

The documentation for fcap is somewhat incomplete, feel 
free to direct further questions to the janus mailing
list (see the MANUAL or README in the Janus distribution
on how to join).
