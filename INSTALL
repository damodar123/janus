Installation instructions for Janus
-----------------------------------

Janus is a package that allows you to run other applications 
in a restricted "sandboxed" environment. The program 
that allows you to do this is called janus, it requires
the use of a kernel module called mod_janus. In order
to use janus you must also install mod_janus.

System requirements:

* mod_janus will run only under the x86 architecture
* mod_janus is not SMP safe at this time.
* mod_janus has only be tested with the 2.2.x Linux kernel
  (specifically 2.2.5,2.2.9,2.2.12,2.2.14,2.2.16),
  but if you are running a different version of the
  2.2.x kernel you should still be fine.


Installing:

1) Modify the top level makefile to reflect where you
   want janus installed.

Note: You must typically be root in order for this to work!

$ make install 

will build janus and mod_janus and install janus in 
the location you specified.

2) Installing mod_janus

As mod_janus does not have a permanent major number assigned to
you must create a new device entry for it each time it
is loaded, this is not all that bad, as the script 

Note: install_mod loads a kernel module so you must run
      it as root.

To install mod_janus now simply run install_mod.
install_mod will take care of this all for you. 

You must run install_mod before you can use janus!!

If you would like to have mod_janus installed at startup 
simply add install_mod to the appropriate startup
script (rc.local on redhat for example).

To test that janus is installed properly you can 
try running bash in a trivial sandbox with the command.

janus -i -f examples/tiny.janus /bin/bash

Once you have successfully installed janus, see janus(1) and
the contents of the docs directory for further instructions
on using janus.

Uninstalling
------------

Note: this must be run as root

To remove the kernel module and device entry simply run
remove_mod.

then manually remove janus.1, janus and mod_janus from where
they were installed (look at the top level make file
for the location that was set).
